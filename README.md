# ApiOS

**ApiOS** (Project Apollo) is an experimental open-source project exploring the concept of AI as an Operating System (OS).  

It treats **specifications as a language**, where nouns, verbs, and adjectives become programmable objects.  
- **Nouns** → objects or entities  
- **Verbs** → nano-services (actions)  
- **Adjectives** → attributes or states  

This creates a living, extensible runtime where software can be described, generated, and executed dynamically.

## Vision
ApiOS is not just another application framework.  
It’s an **AI-driven shell** where language, specification, and execution converge.  

The long-term goals:
- Build a **runtime specification engine** (language of nouns, verbs, adjectives).  
- Create **dynamic nano-services** (verbs as libraries, semver-controlled).  
- Model relationships between entities, attributes, and transformations.  
- Develop an **ecosystem of contributors** experimenting with the concept of "AI as OS".
