Goal: Implement the user interaction daemon and basic dashboard.

Instructions:
- Python daemon that receives user input (CLI or WebSocket terminal) and routes it to the linguistic analysis daemon.
- Return responses and object updates to the user.
- Dashboard monitors running daemons via UNIX sockets, displays system status, and shows current nouns/adjectives/verbs.
- Minimalistic dashboard (terminal-based UI using curses or textual frameworks).
- Output full Python code and instructions for running both daemon and dashboard in Docker environment.
