Goal: Set up the initial databases and system namespaces.

Instructions:
- In MongoDB, create collections for nouns, verbs, adjectives, libraries, users, and sessions.
- Initialize SQLite for lightweight metadata or state snapshots.
- Implement versioning of objects (semver style).
- Provide Python scripts for bootstrap of the initial “root” namespace.
- Ensure scripts can be run in the Docker environment from ACTION-001.
- Output all scripts, commands, and configurations.
