# ApiOS Local Build Instructions

This guide explains how to build and run **ApiOS** locally using your own LLM instance.  

> ⚠️ Experimental: ApiOS was designed with GPT-5 in mind. Running with local LLMs (e.g., LLaMA, MPT) may work, but results and reliability are **not guaranteed**.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed
- Python 3.10+ and Go 1.20+ installed (for native execution if desired)
- MongoDB and SQLite (or use Docker containers)
- Optional local LLM (e.g., LLaMA, MPT) configured for inference

---

## 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ApiOS.git
cd ApiOS
````

---

## 3. Configure Your Local LLM

1. Place your model weights in `./models/` or another accessible path.
2. Update `config/local_model.yaml` with:

   ```yaml
   model_type: llama
   model_path: ./models/7B/
   tokenizer_path: ./models/7B/tokenizer.model
   ```
3. Ensure the model inference server (if applicable) is running.

> Note: You may also connect ApiOS to other LLM families — adjust the API interface accordingly.

---

## 4. Initialize the Environment

1. Start Docker services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

2. Verify MongoDB and SQLite are running and accessible.
3. Bootstrap the root namespace:

```bash
python scripts/init_system.py
```

---

## 5. Running Daemons Locally

* **Linguistic Analysis Daemon**:

```bash
python daemons/linguistic_analysis.py
```

* **Library Evolution Daemon**:

```bash
python daemons/library_evolution.py
```

* **User Interaction Daemon / Dashboard**:

```bash
python daemons/user_dashboard.py
```

> All daemons communicate via UNIX sockets. Ensure socket paths in `config/sockets.yaml` are correct.

---

## 6. Experimenting

* Each stage can be guided with **ACTION-nnn.txt** files.
* You can modify the prompts for your local model.
* Observe logs in `logs/` to see how the local LLM interprets the linguistic specification.

---

## 7. Limitations

* Performance and parsing quality depend heavily on the model.
* Local LLMs may produce inconsistent behavior compared to GPT-5.
* This build is for experimentation and prototyping.

---

## 8. Contribution

* If you improve local compatibility or extend daemon functionality, submit PRs to the main repo.
* Document your experiments in `docs/experimental_local.md`.

---

## 9. References

* ApiOS Core: [README.md](README.md)
* Development ACTION files: `ACTION-001.txt` → `ACTION-005.txt`

> Enjoy exploring language as an OS!

```

You can now copy this entire block and save it as `README-LOCAL.md` in your repo.  

Next, we can start with **ACTION-001** to set up the Docker environment and base containers. Do you want me to generate that?
