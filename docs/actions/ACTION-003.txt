Goal: Implement a daemon for linguistic analysis.

Instructions:
- Python-based daemon that reads natural language input and parses it into noun/adjective/verb structures.
- Use a queue or raw UNIX socket to receive input.
- Output structured objects to the library evolution daemon.
- Ensure it runs as a background service in the Docker environment.
- Include logging for each analyzed phrase.
- Output full Python code and instructions for running the daemon.

ACTION-003: Initialize SQLite Schema

Objective:
- Define and create the initial SQLite database schema for ApiOS.

Steps:
1. Verify the SQLite container/service (apios-sqlite) is running and has write access to /data.
2. Create the following tables:
   - linguistic_objects
   - library_definitions
   - user_interactions
3. Ensure idempotency â€” script should not fail if tables already exist.
4. Write initialization SQL into steps/a003.sql and a runner script in steps/a003.bash.

Expected Outcome:
- SQLite database contains the three tables with correct schema.
- Initialization can be re-run without errors or duplication.
